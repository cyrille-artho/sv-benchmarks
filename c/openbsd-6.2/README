The patch file in sources/007_etherip.patch.sig was obtained from
https://www.openbsd.org/errata62.html and contains the necessary changes
to remove a use-after-free bug. The patch utility will warn on the
"untrusted comment" in the first line but should then proceed. The file was
left unmodified as available online.

Originally these files are compiled with the unsupported OpenBSD 6.2 release
and the systems compiler:
